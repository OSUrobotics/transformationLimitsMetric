A sad attempt to organize what needs to be done:
 * Add data output to 2D simulation -- COMPLETE
	-How and what information do we want to output / save?
	-Try storing output as a table with 4 rows: x, y, t, and % completion as a value from 0 to 1
 * Write / use stl file importing scripts -- COMPLETE
	-stlTools imports both binary and ascii to verts, faces, normals, and name
 * Write % collision of meshes script -- COMPLETE
	-Find volume of meshes -- Done using stlVolume or stlVolumeNormals, depending on the mesh
	-Find intersection of meshes
	-CALCULATE!!!
 * Write 3D transformation script -- COMPLETE
	-Figure out how to deal with position and rotation sampling in 3D -- COMPLETE
	-Figure out how to properly transform an object -- COMPLETE
 * Create 3D simulation -- COMPLETE
	-Combine 3D transformations with collision detection to do what the 2D sim does in 3D
 * Add data output to 3D simulation -- COMPLETE
	-Store data in an array with the collums storing step, x,y,z pos, x,y,z,w rot, and % collision.  The 3rd index represent the various extremes we are approaching.
 * Read data and display -- COMPLETE

 * Run simulation on actual grasps
	-Figure out how to scale the input objects accurately
	-Add a way to align objects easily (Perhaps save them in a way that they import nicely)

 * Celebrate?
