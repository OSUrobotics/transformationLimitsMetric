* [Stanford synthetic object grasping point dataset](http://pr.cs.cornell.edu/grasping/point_data/data.php). Has images instead of STL files. *Not used.*
* [Deep Learning Data/Code](http://pr.cs.cornell.edu/grasping/rect_data/data.php). Only images and pointclouds. *Not used.*
* [See & Grasp Data Set](https://www.bcs.rochester.edu/people/robbie/jacobslab/dataset.html). Has dataset of objects (Fribbles), yet uses a GraspIt! simulated human hand with joint angles. *Not used.*
* [Columbia Grasp Database](http://grasping.cs.columbia.edu/). Has large number of objects and grasps, in postgreSQL database of GraspIt! configurations.
 * Objects are from the [Princeton Shape Benchmark](http://shape.cs.princeton.edu/benchmark/)
