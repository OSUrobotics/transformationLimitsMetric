* [Stanford synthetic object grasping point dataset](http://pr.cs.cornell.edu/grasping/point_data/data.php). Has images instead of STL files. *Not used.*
* [Deep Learning Data/Code](http://pr.cs.cornell.edu/grasping/rect_data/data.php). Only images and pointclouds. *Not used.*
* [See & Grasp Data Set](https://www.bcs.rochester.edu/people/robbie/jacobslab/dataset.html). Has dataset of objects (Fribbles), yet uses a GraspIt! simulated human hand with joint angles. *Not used.*
* [Columbia Grasp Database](http://grasping.cs.columbia.edu/). Has large number of objects and grasps, in postgreSQL database of GraspIt! configurations.
 * Objects are from the [Princeton Shape Benchmark](http://shape.cs.princeton.edu/benchmark/)
* [KIT ObjectModels](https://h2t-projects.webarchiv.kit.edu/Projects/ObjectModelsWebUI/index.php?section=listAll) is a dataset of objects, yet it does not have associated grasps.
* [PaCMan Project](http://www.pacman-project.eu/datasets/) has grasping datasets in unknown format - they have 3d meshes, yet possibly not associated with the grasping set.
* [unipi-grasp-datasets](https://github.com/CentroEPiaggio/unipi-grasp-datasets) software used with the PaCMan project to generate datasets somehow.
* [A Side of Data with My Robot](http://www.willowgarage.com/sites/default/files/ram_2011_datasets.pdf) (Pg 9, Fig. 6) references a PR2 dataset with 3d models and multiple grasps
